# Medical-Office-App
In this app the users are doctors or patients. The doctors can register their private medical office on the app, so the patients can see information about it and can do an appointment and go to a consultation. After the consultation is done, the doctor will release a prescription for the patient. After the patient followed the prescription, he can delete it, so id doesn't display anymore on the patient's page.
